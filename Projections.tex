\section{Introduction}


Let  $C_1,\dots, C_k$ be closed convex subsets in a Hadamard space $X$.
Denote by $P_i$ the closest-point projection $X\to C_i$; it sends a point $x\in X$ to the (nesesary unique) point in $C_i$ that minimize the distance to $x$.
Given a point $x\in X$ consider the sequence $x_n=P^n(x)$, where
$P= P_1\circ \dots \circ P_k$.

If $X$ is a Hilbert space, then the fundamental result of Heinz Bauschke \cite{Bauschke,Kohlenbach}, states that the map $P$ is \emph{asymptotically regular}, that is, for any $x$, we have  $|x_n-x_{n+1}|\to0$ as $n\to \infty$.
In this note we show that this statement does not hold general Hadamard space.
That answers the question of Miroslav Bacak \cite[Problem 6.13]{Bac}.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm}
There exists a Hadamard space $X$ and closed convex subsets $C_1,\dots,C_k$ in $X$ such that the composition of the closest-point projections $P= P_1\circ \dots \circ P_k$ is not asymptotically regular.

Moreover, we can assume that $X$ is compact, $k=3$, each $C_i$ is isometric to the unit interval $[0,1]$, 
and $P$ is an isometry of $C_1$ that swaps its ends.
\end{thm}

The constructed space contains three convex flat quadrangles $Q_1$, $Q_2$, and $Q_3$ with pairs of opposite sides $(C_1,C_2)$, $(C_2,C_3)$, and $(C_3,C_1)$ and the union of the quadrangles is a Möbius band.

If the sets $C_1,\dots,C_k$ have a common intersection, then such examples are impossible \cite{asymptotic,Bac2,Bac}.

It is possible to vary the construction and obtain a compact Hadamard space $X$ and a finite sequence of convex subsets $C_1,\dots,C_k$ all isometric to the unit disc, such that the composition $P=P_1\circ \dots\circ      P_k :C_1\to C_1$  is a rotation of the disc by an arbitrary (especially an irrational) angle.

On the other hand, in case of two subsets the result of  Heinz Bauschke \cite{Bauschke} admits a generalization:

\begin{thm}{Proposition} \label{prop}
For any two closed convex subsets $C_1,C_2$ of any Hadamard space $X$, for any starting point $x\in X$  the sequence $x_n = P^n (x)$ with $P=  P_1\circ P_2 :X\to C_1$ is asymptotically  regular.

Moreover for any $x$ there is a constant $A$ such that 
$|x_n-x_{n+1}| \leq \frac  {A} {\sqrt m}$,
where $x_n=P^n(x)$;
here we $|x_n-x_{n+1}|$ denotes the distance between the points $x_n$ and $x_{n+1}$ in $X$.
\end{thm}


\section{Two subsets}

We will assume some familiarity with the geometry of CAT(0) spaces, \cite{BH,AKP}.

\begin{proof}[Proof of \ref{prop}]
By definition,  $x_n \in C_1$ for all $n$.
Set $y_n= P_2 (x_n)$, so $y_n$ is the closest-point projection of $x_n$ to $C_2$.
Further set 
\begin{align*}
r_n:=|x_n-x_{n+1}|,
s_n:=|y_n-y_{n+1}|,
\end{align*}
Note that 
\[r_1 \geq s_1 \geq r_2\geq s_2\geq\dots
\eqlbl{eq:rsrsrsrs}
\]

Set
\begin{align*}
a_n &\df |x_n-y_n|= \dist_{C_2}x_n,\\
 b_n &\df |y_n-x_{n+1}|= \dist_{C_1}y_n.
\end{align*}
Note that
\[a_1 \geq b_1 \geq a_2 \geq b_2 \geq \dots
\eqlbl{eq:abababa}\]

The CAT(0) comparison implies that 
\[r_n^2  \leq a_n^2-b_n^2.\]
Therefore \ref{eq:abababa} implies that 
\[\sum_{n} r_n ^2\le a_1^2.\]
By \ref{eq:rsrsrsrs}, $r_n$ is non-increasing.
Therefore $r_n \leq \tfrac A {\sqrt{n}}$, for some constant~$A$.
\end{proof}

\section{Main example}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{thm}]
Fix a small $\epsilon >0$.
Consider the round sphere~$\mathbb{S}^2$ and the closed 
$\epsilon$-neighborhood $A$  of its equator.
The space $A$ is locally CAT(1) \cite{LWcurv}.
The universal cover $\tilde A$ of $A$ with its induced metric is locally CAT(1) as well. 

Denote by $E$ the preimage of the equator in $\tilde A$  and by $H^{\pm}$ the boundary curves of the stripe $\tilde A$, which are both convex in $\tilde A$.
The isometry group of $\tilde A$ 
contains the group of translations  along $E$ (the preimage of rotations of the sphere) and 
the reflection across $E$ that swaps $H^+$ and $H^-$.
Let $g$   be the composition of translation along $E$  of length $2\pi +10\cdot\epsilon$  and the reflection $r$.
The element $g$ generates a discrete group $\Gamma$ isomorphic to $\mathbb Z$ in the group of isometries  of $\tilde A$.
The group $\Gamma$ acts freely on $\tilde A$ and the quotient space $Y =\tilde A/\Gamma$ is a Möbius band.

Since $\eps$ is small, it is easy to see that every point of $\tilde A$ is moved by any element of $\Gamma$ more than $2\cdot\pi$ away from it.
It implies that the locally CAT(1) space $Y$ does not  contain geodesics of length less than $2\pi$, hence $Y$ is CAT(1).
By construction, $Y$ is locally isometric to $\mathbb{S}^2$ outside its boundary curve $B$.
The projection of $E$ to $Y$ is a closed geodesic $G$ of length $2\pi +10\cdot\epsilon$.

Denote by $X$ the Euclidean cone over $Y$.
The space $X$ is CAT(0)  \cite{BBI}.
Moreover, $X$ is locally Euclidean outside its \emph{boundary} --- the cone over $B$.

The cone $Z$ over the closed geodesic $G$ is a locally covex, hence a convex subset of~$X$.
In the space $Z$ is isometric to a cone over a circle of length $2\pi +10\cdot\epsilon$.
Let us consider a triangle
$q_1,q_2,q_3$ 
in $Z$, which contains the origin $o$ of the cone in its interior.

By construction, the triangle $[q_1q_2q_3]$ is contained in the flat part of $X$.
Thus, we can find a small neighborhood $U_1$ of the geodesic $[q_1q_2]$ isometric to a convex subset of the Euclidean space.
Similarly, we find neighborhood $U_2$ of $[q_2q_3]$ and $U_3$ of $[q_3q_1]$.
We find some $r>0$, such that the $r$-neighborhood of $[q_iq_{i+1}]$ is completely contained in $U_i$.

Denote by $C_i$ the segment centered at $q_i$ and being orthogonal to $Z$ at $q_i$.
By construction, $C_i$ and $C_{i+1}$, for $i=1,2,3$   are contained in $U_i$.
Since $Z$ is convex, $C_i$ and $C_{i+1}$ are \emph{parallel} inside $U_i$, thus their convex hull  $Q_i$ is isometric to a rectangle with two opposite sides given by $C_i$ and $C_{i+1}$.
In particular, the metric projection from $C_{i+1}$ to $C_{i}$ is an isometry.

By topological reasons, the union of $Q_1,Q_2,Q_3$ is homeomorphic to the Möbius band.
Thus, going \emph{around} we change the orientation of $C_1$.
This just means, that the composition $P:C_1\to C_1$, which is an isometry by construction, changes the orientation of the segment $C_1$.	
\end{proof}

The same construction works in higher dimensions.
Namely, instead of $A$ we may choose a tubular neighborhood of a closed geodesic in $\mathbb{S}^m$;
by the result of Stephanie Alexander,  David Berg, and Richard Bishop \cite{ABB-1993}, the space $A$ is CAT(1).
Insted of $g$ we may take glide rotation of the $\tilde A$.
That gives a variation of the construction with $C_i$ isometric to a Euclidean disc and $P$ acting on $C_1$ by arbitrary rotation.
